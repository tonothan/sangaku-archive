# About The Sangaku Archive Project

Sangaku (算額) are a custom unique to Japan: votive tablets with mathematical problems, often beautifully illustrated, sangaku were dedicated in temples and shrines throughout the country from the Edo period onwards, well into the twentieth century. The oldest surviving tablet was dedicated in 1682 at Hoshinomiya Shrine in today's Sano City (Tochigi Prefecture), although it is possible that the custom might have started prior. Nowadays, approximately 900 extant tablets survive; a great number of lost tablets are documented in printed books and manuscripts from the Edo period.
The Sangaku Archive project is a 3-year effort to create a digital, open access repository of all sangaku reported extant or documented in writing. In collaboration with temples, shrines and public institutions, the project attempts to preserve the knowledge about sangaku accumulated by many hands over many years, provide English translations where possible and open up new possibilities for research.
This project would not be possible without the generous support of many wasan research groups, cultural property agencies and sangaku owners themselves. Please do look at the acknowledgments.
