# About the Sangaku Archive Project

## Project overview

The Sangaku Archive Project is a three-year effort to collect metadata and images for all sangaku surviving in wood or print in Japan. The aggregated content will be made available in English and Japanese on sangaku-archive.org for the benefit of researchers, enthusiasts or newcomers alike. 
Having started in April 2023, the project is expected to be concluded in April 2026. The current version is a partial release of the data collected up to date.

## Data Collection Process

The metadata from digital and analogue sources maps approximately 900 extant sangaku surviving across all of Japan. The Sangaku Archive Project is collaborating with shrines, temples, governmental and cultural institutions across the country to collect data and image materials for each sangaku insofar as possible. We would like to thank all participating institutions for the patience and kindness granting us the right to make this material public.  

  Whilst some sangaku are on public display, many of them are currently in storage and have been photographed with special permission. We ask all visitors to the archive to respect the wishes of the sangaku owners and refrain from inquiries where such is discouraged.

## Image Permission

For each extant sangaku still held by a shrine or temple, explicit permission has been obtained to publish a photograph online. The image rights for new photos taken in the process have been transferred to the owners or keepers of the sangaku. The entry for each extant sangaku contains the licensing agreements chosen by the owner or keeper of the sangaku. Where a license was chosen from the Creative Commons Network, please see the link in the archive entry to read more about the conditions for reuse. Where an image is marked as "All Rights Reserved", special permission has to be obtained directly from the owner of the sangaku prior to reusing the image. 

  The Sangaku Archive cannot handle inquiries about image permissions, please contact the owner of the image directly.
