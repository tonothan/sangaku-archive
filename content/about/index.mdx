# About the Sangaku Archive Project

## Project overview

The Sangaku Archive Project is a three-year effort to collect metadata and images for all sangaku surviving in wood or print in Japan. The aggregated content will be made available in English and Japanese on sangaku-archive.org for the benefit of researchers, enthusiasts or newcomers alike. 
Having started in April 2023, the project is expected to be concluded in April 2026. The current available version is a partial release of the data collected up to date.

## Data Collection Process

The metadata from digital and analogue sources maps approximately 900 extant sangaku surviving across all of Japan. The Sangaku Archive Project is collaborating with Shrines, Temples, Cultural Property Departments and other institutions across the country to collect data and image materials for each sangaku insofar as possible. For each extant sangaku still held by a shrine or temple, explicit permission has been obtained to publish this material online. The image rights for new photos taken in the process have been transferred to the owners of the sangaku who are invited to choose a license from the Creative Commons Network (or retain All Rights Reserved). Regarding the image rights for each sangaku, please refer to the archive entry. 
We would like to thank all participating institutions for the patience and kindness granting us the right to make this material public. The archive entries also contain visitor information. Whilst some sangaku are on public display, many of them are currently in storage and have been photographed with special permission. We ask all visitors to the archive to respect the wishes of the sangaku owners and refrain from inquiries where such is discouraged.
